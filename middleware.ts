/**
 * This is a UX-level gate only — it reads a client-settable cookie, so
 * it cannot be trusted as the real security boundary (a cookie set by
 * JS in the browser can be forged). The backend's `auth(...roles)`
 * middleware, which re-validates the JWT and current DB role on every
 * request, is what actually enforces authorization. This middleware's
 * job is purely to avoid flashing a protected page's layout/shell to an
 * unauthenticated visitor before a client-side redirect would kick in,
 * and to bounce a logged-in user away from the wrong dashboard quickly.
